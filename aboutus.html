        <h2 style="color: #4676a9">About Us</h2>
       <p>Welcome to our event management website at DR. B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology. I'm thrilled to introduce you to this platform, which has been meticulously designed to enhance the event experience for both organizers and participants. Let me provide you with an in-depth overview of our website and its purpose.</p>
       <p>The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to offer a comprehensive understanding of our event management website. It outlines the functional and non-functional requirements that guide our development team in creating a system that simplifies the event management process. Our website aims to create a user-friendly and efficient platform that centralizes event creation, registration, attendance tracking, and feedback collection for various clubs within our institute. We're here to streamline the event management process and provide a convenient experience for all involved.</p>
       <p>Our platform offers several key features, and it's important to highlight them. Club admins can easily create new events by providing essential event details, such as title, date, time, location, description, and event category. Students and faculty can register for events through our website, offering their name, email, and other relevant information. We've also implemented a robust attendance tracking system that enables event organizers to efficiently mark attendees' presence during events. Additionally, we've integrated a feedback collection system to gather valuable input from participants, ensuring that we continually improve the event experience.</p>
       <p>In terms of non-functional requirements, our website is designed with performance in mind, ensuring quick loading times and responsiveness even with a significant number of simultaneous users. Security is a top priority, with user data stored securely and encrypted, and certain features restricted to authorized club admins. Our website boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring accessibility and easy navigation for users, including those with disabilities. Moreover, we've built our website to accommodate future growth without requiring major architectural changes, and we even offer face detection for attendance tracking.</p>
       <p>Our website follows a three-tier architecture, with distinct layers for presentation, application, and data management. These layers work seamlessly to provide you with the features and functionalities you need. We also maintain various data entities, including event details, user information, attendance records, and feedback data.</p>
       <p>In addition, we integrate with an email service to send event registration confirmations and reminders to our participants, ensuring a smooth and informative experience.</p>
       <p>Finally, we have some assumptions and dependencies that we would like to share with you. These include assumptions about the availability of necessary infrastructure and technologies for our development team, as well as users having a stable internet connection to access the website. Additionally, our development timeline depends on the availability of the development team and resources, and the successful deployment relies on the proper configuration and setup of the chosen email service for event notifications.</p>
       <p>Thank you for considering our event management website at DR. B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology. We're committed to providing you with a seamless and enjoyable event experience, and we look forward to your involvement.</p>
